Qom
===

Qom is a new lumped rainfall-runoff hydrologic model which is featured by a limited set of continuous decision variables associated with soil moisture and direct runoff. It described in the paper `[ZGN20] <https://doi.org/10.3390/app10010251>`_, where a multi-objective optimization approach is used for the calibration of the model.

In this project we provide Qom as a standalone Java problem, that can be executed from the command line with the only requirement of having a JRE 8+ (Java Runtime Environment version 8 or higher) installed.
